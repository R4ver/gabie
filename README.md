# Gabie

Gabie is a boilerplate using Gulp(Added soon), Webpack 2 and BrowserSync.
Included is [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) as the CSS framework which is highly cosumizable. jQuery is also included.

### A little about Bulma (*[From the readme on github](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma)*)
Bulma is a modern CSS framework based on [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes). 
Bulma is a **CSS** framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: [bulma.css](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/css/bulma.css)

You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the [variables](http://bulma.io/documentation/overview/variables/).

There is **no** JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Bulma can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.
